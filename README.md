FreeRPG is a spigot 1.15+ plugin that adds an RPG skill system to minecraft. Inspired by Mcmmo, the
goal is to offer a free Mcmmo alternative. Each skill has a skill tree, with an additional global
skill tree. The skill trees can be accessed with a very simplistic, Hypixel inspired GUI accessed
using ``/frpg``.

## Installation

### Current Updates

Current version is 1.4.52, check the tags/releases on GitHub for a current version or build it
yourself from source.

## Getting Started

To install on any Spigot server, simply drag the ``freerpg-{version}.jar`` file into the plugins
folder.

To get started playing, type ``/frpg``. This will bring up the Skills GUI seen in the gif above.
Clicking on any of the icons will take you to that skill's skill tree. Hovering over any of the
icons or clicking on them will tell you more about the perk.

Earning experience is straightforward, mine to get mining experience, cut trees to get woodcutting
experience, etc. By the default config, every level you will gain **1 passive token** which can be
invested in the passive skills represented by the dyes on the left. Every 100 levels, you will
gain **1 skill token** which can be invested in the skills represented by the terracotta skill tree.
Every 1000 levels, you will gain **1 global token** that can be used in the global skill tree.

To activate abilities, in most cases you can right click the corresponding tool then break a block.
The 10 abilities are as follows:

* **Big Dig**: Increases dig speed drastically.
    * Activated by right clicking a shovel then breaking a block.
* **Timber**: Will cause all logs above to break.
    * Activated by right clicking an axe then cutting a log.
* **Berserk Pick**: Will increase mining speed drastically.
    * Activated by right clicking a pickaxe then breaking a block.

    * Activated by right clicking a sword then hitting an entity.
* **Stone Solid**: Grants resistance at the cost of being slowed down.
    * Activated by right clicking with an empty hand then hitting an entity.
